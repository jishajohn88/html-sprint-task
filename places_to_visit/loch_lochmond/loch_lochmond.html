                    Loch Lomond Shores is situated in Balloch in the stunning Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park, so you're in for a treat with the lush scenery and landscapes. Get out on the water with boat tours and watersports, or keep your feet dry and try out Treezone or the SEA LIFE Loch Lomond Aquarium. The kids will love the dinosaur themed 
                    Jurassic Grill, or if you're looking to tuck into something local and fresh, pop by the farmers market every 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.
