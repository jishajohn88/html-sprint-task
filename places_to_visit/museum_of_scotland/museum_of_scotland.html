                Set on Edinburgh's Chambers Street, the National Museum of Scotland is a treasure trove of ancient artefacts and precious objects. 
                Not only one of the best attractions in Scotland, it's also one of the most popular in the UK outside of London and offers a great, 
                year-round programme of temporary exhibitions and events.
